# library
An Odin Training Project using Objects to create a Library for storing books

This project is looking to practice prototypes
and prototypal inheritance using objects. The goal
is to create a constructor function for adding books and a function for storing them in an array, and being able to view them in a table.

- The books should be removable, and have a unique id.

- New books should be addable to the library either using dialogs and modals or using a form.

- The books will need a checkbox that marks whether its read or not. Toggling this will also need to
toggle the isRead boolean for that specific book.

Achievements:

This project helped with practicing prototypal inheritance when making a shared toggledRead
function between every new book.

It also allowed for experimenting with new
styling in the form of a dialog modals.
