# library
An Odin Training Project using Objects to create a Library for storing books

This project is looking to practice prototypes
and prototypal inheritance using objects. The goal
is to create functions for adding books, storing them
in an array, and being able to view them in a table.
The books should be removable, have a unique id.

New books should be addable to the library either using
dialogs and modals or using a form.

The books will need a checkbox button that marks whether
its read or not.

Lets get it!
